### An organization has just hired you as a new Scrum Master to help them transition their teams from their current traditional process to Scrum. The teams are currently structured to specialize in a single function. This is also known as component teams where a team would only address a single layer (i.e. design, frontend, backend, database, testing, etc.). You've introduced the concept of cross-functional teams where all the skills needed to produce business functionality, from end to end, are inside of a single team.What should you keep in mind when transitioning from siloed teams to cross-functional teams? (Choose two.)

- [ ] It is easier to compare the performance between cross-functional teams in order to identify to which teams to assign tasks and which teams need additional coaching.
- [x] Newly formed teams will need time to stabilize before reaching their peak performance. During the initial stages of forming, performance will suffer and productivity may be low, although even then delivery of business value is still likely to increase.
- [ ] Without feature teams, you cannot do Scrum. Postpone Scrum adoption until the teams are reorganized in feature teams.
- [x] People from the different layers and components will need time to become accustomed to working and delivering unified functionality together as one Scrum Team thus productivity may suffer.

### Paul is a Product Owner for multiple products. Each product is allocated a dedicated Scrum Team and a set budget. Based on the average velocity of a previous product release, Paul had estimated a new product to take 9 Sprints to complete. The average velocity of the previous product release was 50 completed units of work per Sprint. Over the first 3 Sprints, the Development Team reported an average velocity of 40 completed units per Sprint, while not fully completing the required integration tests. The Development Team estimates that integration testing would require additional effort to make the increments shippable. TheDevelopment Team is unsure if the required velocity is achievable.What is the most effective way to recover?
 
- [ ] In the next Sprints, the Development Team strives to make the selected work as close to 'done' as possible and at the minimum 90% completed. Any undone work is divided into new Product Backlog Items that will be deferred to the last Sprint in order to maintain stable velocity.
- [x] The Development Team informs Paul that the progress he has perceived to date is not correct. The Increment is not releasable. They give Paul their estimate of the effort it would take to get the previous work 'done', and suggest doing that work first before proceeding with new features. The team also re-estimates the effort to make the remaining Product Backlog items 'done', including all integration effort. In the end, it is Paul's call to continue the project or to cancel.
- [ ] The Scrum Master will manage the Sprint Backlog and assign work to the Development Team members to ensure maximum utilization of each member. He/ she will keep track of unused resources so that it does not impact the budget. Unused budget can be allocated for additional Sprints if needed.
- [ ] The Scrum Master sets the open work aside to be performed in one or more release Sprints. They remind Paul to find funding for enough Release Sprints in which this remaining work can be done. Up to one release Sprint per three development Sprints may be required. It is Paul's role to inform users and stakeholders of the impact on the release date.

(Choose three.)

- [x] Impediments are raised and resolved more slowly.
- [x] Opportunities to inspect and adapt the Sprint Backlog are reduced.
- [x] Less information about the progress will be shared causing the Sprint plan to become inaccurate and reducing transparency over progress toward the Sprint Goal.

### Steven is a Scrum Master asked to assist in creating five new Scrum Teams that will be working to build a highly anticipated product. He talks with them about the importance of being able to integrate their Increments by the end of their Sprints. This includes the first Sprints. The product is very important to both the end users and the organization.Of the choices raised by future team members, what would Steven encourage?

- [ ] Each Scrum Team delivers Increments in its own code branch. After UAT is performed at the Sprint Review, the code branch is isolated until enough Increments are considered acceptable. All code branches will then be merged during the release phase.
- [ ] Each Scrum Team delivers functionality at the end of each Sprint. New Product Backlog items will then be added to the next Sprint Backlog to integrate their functionality with the other teams to create a unified Increment.
- [x] All Scrum Teams agree on a mutual understanding of 'done' that defines all work necessary to deliver a potentially shippable Increment that includes all previous Increments delivered for the product.

The Product Owner, however, was able to clearly define the business objective he hopes to achieve in the Sprint.Which of the following two actions would you support? (Choose two.)

- [x] The Development Team forecasts the most likely Product Backlog items to meet the business objective and create a Sprint Backlog based on a likely initial design and plan. Once the time- box for the Sprint Planning meeting is over, they start implementation and continue to analyze, decompose, and create additional functionality during the Sprint.
- [ ] If all agree they can extend the Sprint Planning until the Development Team can forecast enough Product Backlog items before starting the implementation.
- [ ] Allow the Development Team members as much time as needed to review the Product Backlog items and reconvene with the Product Owner when they are confident enough to make a forecast for the Sprint.
- [x] They discuss in the upcoming Sprint Retrospective why this happened and what changes will make it less likely to occur again.

- [ ] You tell the Product Owner to make sure that there are no ambiguities or possible misunderstandings in the items on the Product Backlog when they are handed over to the Development Team. This is best done by capturing the functional requirements during an analysis phase, resulting in documents that are considered as the working product of such analysis Sprints.
- [x] You advise the Product Owner to rely on the Development Team and the stakeholders to formulate the Product Backlog, as they are the ones most knowledgeable. By asking questions and working with them the Product Owner will quickly be up to speed.

### Your company has notified the stakeholders that they will be delivering the first release of a new product within ten Sprints. On the seventh Sprint, the ScrumTeam discovers that they will not be able to include all of the expected features within the first release. The Product Owner believes if they remove some items from the Definition of Done they will be able to accelerate the development process. The Development Team objects to this idea as it will lead to technical debt.
As a Scrum Master, what would be the best two ways to explain to the Product Owner the impact of technical debt? (Choose two.)

- [ ] As long as there is still technical debt in the current release, feature development for the next release cannot be started. The Product Owner must first agree to this impact before allowing changes to the Definition of Done.
- [ ] Reducing the Definition of Done will introduce unknown errors as development progresses and functionality is added. The system can become more difficult to stabilize as work progresses. Development for the actual release as well as future releases will be slowed down in unpredictable ways.
- [x] Releasing the version upon a reduced Definition of Done creates false assumptions about the actual state of the system. This will create many interruptions during the development of the next release as fixes will need to be done to the previous release caused from a reduction of quality.
- [x] The amount of technical debt will need to be analyzed in order to understand the impact on subsequent releases in order to allocate additional Sprints at the end of the project.
